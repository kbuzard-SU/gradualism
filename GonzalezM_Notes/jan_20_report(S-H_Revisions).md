# Remaining thoughts for coding S-H and Geneva
## January 20th, 2021

### Schedule 1 

p.5: 
    
- Some differences between description in S-H and Geneva
- I have included the very general description provided in S-H. I'm not sure if this is necessary as it creates a question of how to deal with the divergence in later paragraphs
p.6: (Aluminum sulphate):
- ~~This is an example that comes up again in later paragraphs. Here we see that S-H has two separate tax rates for aluminum sulphate. Starting in Geneva, these tax boundaries are removed and only one entry is used. I believe that we can code this as two separate entries (instead of 1, or even 3). Then when the entries converge in Geneva, we can make note of this and code the two separate rates with the same tax rate thereafter.~~
p.8:

- This paragraph seems to be accurate, but I should note that there were some slightly different descriptions between S-H and Torquay. These are documented in "Extra" col

p.24: 

- The entries from Dillon are not specified in S-H. I coded these based on the assumption that they would be taxed at the rates specified based on alcohol content provided in p.24
p.27.1.5, p.27.3.5, 27.a.4.5:
    - Maybe some typos in description
    - Difficult to code these entries in S-H, I have done my best here
p.28.a:
    - Difficult to code Geneva56 entry, but it seems to fit
p.68:

   - ~~Two lines converge in Geneva1. Should we delete the more general description that was taken from Torquay?~~

p.201.b:

- Tax interval in S-H?
p.207: 

- Bauxite, calcined etc...: Not sure how I can make this fit in S-H

p.212:

- This should be revisited
p.219: 
- Changing some of the descriptions slightly to capture boundaries from S-H to Torquay:
   - more specifically: An example is that I changed, "Not over 384 sq inches" to "Over 150 but not over 384 sq inches"

p.222.d: 
    

- This is difficult to code in S-H because I am not sure that this entry really matches well with any previous description.
p.226: 
- "With edges unground" is a general description in S-H, that later has more specific entries in Torquay. Maybe this should be moved to be directly under similar entry

p.304: 

- The descriptions here may have to be reorganized, some items might be duplicates, but it is difficult to tell

p.309:

- Some paragraphs in S-H don't seem to match exactly with later schedules. Highlighted

p.339: 

- Added uniform rate across nspf items:

p.345: 

- I developed the paragraph description here. S-H originally has 2 entries for saddlery and then for riding bridle hardware. These entries converge in Geneva1. To capture the initial divergence in S-H, I added lines 

p.353: 

- This paragraph is still an issue: An idea is that we can code the entire paragraph with a uniform tax rate and specify instances where and item is NS in S-H

p.355:

- I'd like this to be looked over to make sure that it makes sense

p.358:

- I changed the descriptions so that the convergence from S-H to Torquay is shown


p.359:

- I added entries for each item such that each can be made of glass. This may not be necessary

p.366: 

- Parts and fittings... 50 Ad Val, or 55? Or 50 + 55? The description is unclear   

p.367:
- Entered paragraph in NE

p.368:

- Unsure about how to code some of the Dillon entries. If they fall under 368.c_19, then they can possibly be taxed at 65 Ad. Val. Maybe these entries belong in 368.a? 
p.369:
- Inner tube entry seems to fit with same tax rate as parts nspf, but unsure
p.372: 
- Highlighted section. Similar to 353
- Sewing machine example: Edited/added rows to deal with changing tax boundary
- Dillon entries, beginning with, "For textile manufacturing or processing..." Fall under the category, "textile machinery, finished or unfinished nspf:" in Dillon, so they are taxed in S-H as such
- Not sure how to deal with: "The rate for the article of which they are parts"

p.382: 
- Aluminum foil over xx inch but less than 0.006 inch...: I changed the entries here such that each is coded with a 40 AV. This changes to specific in Gen56. Not sure if this is an error, but want to highlight this

p. 397: 
- A couple of difficulties coding Dillon entries
- A large section with a uniform tax rate

p.412: 

- Large uniform rate for most of nspf section

p.601: 

- Issue coding a NE from geneva

p.701:

- Changed descriptions for entries based on cattle weights to accommodate changes in tax boundary from S-H to Geneva1 the following
- No "provided" in S-H
p.707: 

- "Provided" paragraph is NS in S-H, though based on Geneva1, I have suggested a specific tax
- This occurs twice, for both "Provided" entries

p.709:
    

- "Provided" entry has same issue as p.707

p.710: 
    
- Made assumptions based on tax intervals, and cheese not specified ins S-H

p.715: 
    

- In S-H, the description is, "Live animals, vertebrate and invertebrate nspf:"

p.717:
    

- First line in 717.a can most likely be deleted. Holding off here
- Surgery on this paragraph in order to deal with grouping of fish that changes across rounds

p.717.b:

- "Provided" paragraph difficulty

p.717.c:

- Difficulty with grouping "Fish, dried and unsalted" across rounds

p.718.c:
    
- Original description is very general, all items are marked NS

p.719.4: 

- **NEEDS TO BE ORGANIZED. DIFFICULT**

p.721.d:

- I've developed cleaner descriptions for this paragraph. This is provided in the NE sheet

p.761: 

- "Provided" paragraph is difficult to code

p.770: 

- How to code onion sets?

p.771:

- "Provided" sections for White and Irish potatoes. Taxing at the same rate as white and Irish potatoes

p.805: 

- "Provided": Theres a note from Victor here where thinks this should not be included. Not sure here

p.810: 

- Do we have a method to deal with this type of entry? 

p.901.a:

- Added row and changed description because initially S-H describes rates for over/under 90. Then Geneva1 describes rates for over/under 60

p.901.b:

- Same comment as 901.a

p.902:

- This is probably an easy fix. I'm just not sure if I should go ahead and code the tax intervals

p.904.a:


- Added row and changed description of boundary because S-H first describes rates for over/under 90, but Geneva bases rates on over/under 80  

911.a:

- Coded a tax interval. Seems accurate compared to Geneva, but I am a little unsure

p.1003:


- Potential tax interval?

p.1012: 


- Split into two entries to account for changing in grouping across schedules


p.1105.a.b:


- Split a mungo and wool rags into two entries, though these are later grouped in Geneva1



p.1107:


- S-H originally has tax boundaries, and does not differentiate between Angora/Rabbit and other. Deal with this, I added lines for tax boundaries, and noted that these entries converge later on 
p.1108, 1109.a, 1109.b:

- **Very tricky**. Having difficult with grouping items, with warp vs without, and OTHER     
p.1110: 

- Changed description slightly. S-H, wholly cut/uncut is separated from partly cut. This converges in Geneva1

p.1111: 

- Deleted row from torquay description. 3 rows that specify value remain. These entries are originally from S-H. Yet, they converge in Geneva1 ("regardless of value") is stated, so uniform tax is applied thereafter

p.1116.b 

- I've coded this like we have for other tax intervals

p.1117.a

- Changed descriptions here, Note items converge in Geneva1, then again in Torquay and thereafter

p.1119:

- This paragraph refers back to 1108 and 1109, I'm not sure I can code this accurately until I have 1108 and 1109 Corrected


p.1206.1.2.3:

- Not sure how to code first entry of this paragraph

p.1301:


- Possible tax boundary 

p.1306:


- Edited description from Geneva1 (Where jacquard and not jacquard grouped together). I do this because these two entries were separated in S-H

p.1307:

- Same note as p.1306



p.1405:


- Potential duplicate from Dillon (embossed or printed otherwise than lithographically)
- Missing NE in S-H?

p.1406: 

- "Shall be subject to the same rate of duty as hereinbefore provided for cigar bands of the same number of colors and printings". Cigar labels have two classifications for wholly or in part metal leaf. Two classification for Cigar bands based on colors. (over 8 colors, under 8 colors) I believe that this can be resolved by splitting this entry into two separate entries based on cigar band color and noting the convergence in Torquay


p.1506:


- Grouping of entries

p.1513:

- Artificiial abrasive section

p.1518:

- Best guess here

p.1526.a 


- Added rows for different tax boundaries, edited some existed tax boundaries to accommodate for the shifting boundaries over time. Corrected these changes across each round
  

p.1527.a.2

- Best guess here

1529.c:

- Changed description of "whether or not containing elastic fabric" in first entry to accomodate the difference in S-H. Then noted that these items converge (are grouped together) in Geneva1

p.1542:


- Records for phongraphs is NS. I've decided to code based on "parts thereof"

p.1559:


- A very general description in S-H
