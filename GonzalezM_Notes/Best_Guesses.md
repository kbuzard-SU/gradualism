### Best Guesses

p.208:

- grouped with bauxite crude, not refined etc, Although it could be grouped with "clays or earths wrough or manufactured nspf: $2/ton"

p.222.d 
    

- "Provided, That none of the foregoing 1/2 inch or more thick and not containing a wire netting within itself shall be subject to less than the following rates of duty: If ground wholly or in part (whether or not polished) otherwise than for the purpose of ornamentation" Coded with 50
- "If not ground wholly or in part" coded with the same. Both are not directly specified. I base this decision off of rates from later rounds

p.366:

- Still an unresolved entry here

p.368:

- continued: Ship's logs and depth-sounding mechanisms, devices , and instruments, valued over $10 each
  - "Not specified in HS, though I think that this can be taxed at same rate as valuations over $10"
    p.368.c 
  - Best guess based on the structure of Dillon entries

p.372:

- Parts nspf, wholly or in chief value of metal or porcelain, of any article provided for in this item: Forged steel grinding balls
  - This is a guess that I am uncomfortable with
- Parts nspf, wholly or in chief value of metal or porcelain, of any article provided for in this item: Other
  - And Again, uncomfortable with this guess 

### Never coded with a specific entry:

- p.810
- p.1408
- p.1549.b: 

### Tax Interval complexities:

- p.902
- p.911.a:  Tax interval issue. Noticing a potential increase in AV
- p.1301: Tax boundaries



**p.719.4 is coded incorrectly or misplaced**

p.770: grouping with onions

p.805: Should be deleted?

p.1206.1.2.3: First entry can potentially be deleted because S-H specifies a different rate for partly cut/wholly cut

-  Potential duplicate "Embossed or otherwise than lithographically."


p.1406: 
- May have to break this into two entries 

p.1532.a Entry from S-H would be difficult to code in our file. Since it only appears in S-H, maybe we don't need it?
