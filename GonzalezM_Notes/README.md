# Gonzalez_M_Notes

## Description: 

I created this folder to organize some of my work and thoughts related to the coding of S-H. The included files will supplement notes in my [progress report](https://github.com/kbuzard-SU/gradualism/blob/master/2020_Winter_RA_Report_Gonzalez.md). The creation of this folder is mentioned in the "Summary/Todo" section of the report from Tuesday, Jan.19.

- Victor indicated that in order to effectively work with our dataset in R, it is important code as many entries in S-H as possible. In the interest of accomplishing this goal, I occasionally had to make assumptions. I documented these instances in this file.
