This seesion is the first session of the independant. It was a good time to sum up what has been accomplished so far and to define what are the objectives, the skills I have to master and the resource I have at my disposal.

##**Question regarding the previous work**

1. About the book, _Politics and trade policy_ by Joe R. Wilkinson:
* there is not much about the trade agreements themselves but rather on how they are negotiated. The trade agreement act is about giving more power to the president to negotiate reciprocal agreements. I should look closer to the arguments in favor and against this new power.
* the technical aspect are not that important: what amount of tariffs is bilaterally removed does not really matter but rather how and why does the agreement can be accepted.
* the structure of the American politics does not allow to directly observe all the steps of the formation of the trade agreement: only one agreement were retoken in Congress because all the agreements that were put to vote were acceptable at the time of the voting. THe formation of the agreement is shaped the expected lobbying by the concerned industries and the expected comportment of the COngress. Therefore, in order to define a pattern, we need to find more than only voting results.In order to do that, it may be important to see the formation of the agenda.

2. About the acquired skills

* R is useful but I need to get more into Git and Github in order to share. A repository will be in place in order to share documents.
* Markdown is to be improved as it would be the dominant format of the shared documents.

##**Next objectives**

1. Familiarized myself with new resources and tools
* Markdown
* Strengthen Git and GitHub use
* Get familiar with the WTO notes
* start reading a new book on trade _Traders and diplomats_ by Ernest H. Preeg

2. Start making summary of the accomplished work
* first session summary
* type _politics and trade policy_ under on text and markdown

3. Start looking for the long run objectives
* who determines the agenda during the GATT rounds?
* Is there any particular exploitable industry that would stand out and be only concerned by changes on tariffs during those rounds?
