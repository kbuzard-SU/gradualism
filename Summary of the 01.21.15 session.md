##Content of the session

1. The organization of the work

Three issue has to be settled. 

* First, the interaction process has to be defined.Three possibilities can be evaluated: pull request, use of Wikis and the Issue function.The choice regarding of the different options will depend of the use of GitHub and my state of learning.
* I should read _The GATT Legal System and World Trade Diplomacy by Robert E. Hudec_ on the history of the WTO.
* The objective has to be clarified. Once the work of the WTO repertory is done, it is important to find the detail agenda of the tariff modification, the cause of settling this agenda and finally the result of it, which is the nature of gradualism.

2. GitHub issue: it is necessary that I keep learning about using Git and GitHub in order to have a nice and professional work.

##Plan and summary

1. Summary of the work done

* Work on data: file _Politics and Trade policy_; reading of the first chapters of _Traders and Diplomats_; I still have to look to the raw data.

2. Plan for the next week
